              <h2>Colombia</h2>
              <p class="about-text">
                Colombia, my home country, is a place of incredible beauty and rich culture. Nestled in the heart 
                of South America, Colombia boasts stunning landscapes, from lush rainforests and majestic mountains 
                to picturesque coastlines. Its vibrant cities, like Bogotá and Medellín, are filled with lively 
                energy and a fusion of traditional and modern charm. The country's diverse culinary scene offers 
                a delightful array of flavors, from savory arepas to tantalizing tropical fruits. Colombia's music, 
                dance, and festivals reflect the vibrant spirit of its people. It's a place that fills me with pride, 
                and I'm grateful to call it home.
              </p>
              <h2>Music</h2>
              <p class="about-text">
                Since I was a child, music has captivated me with its enchanting melodies. Playing the guitar and 
                singing have always brought me immense joy, allowing me to express myself and explore my creativity 
                through music's harmonious language. It has become an integral part of my life, connecting me with 
                others on a deep level. Whether I'm strumming the chords or belting out lyrics, the power of music 
                continues to inspire and drive my artistic journey.
              </p>
              <h2>Books, Poetry & Philosophy</h2>
              <p class="about-text">
                Books, poetry, and philosophy have a special place in my heart. They transport me to different worlds, 
                inspire me, and make me feel connected. Through books, I explore diverse characters and cultures, while 
                poetry's language touches my soul. Engaging with philosophy expands my understanding and encourages me 
                to question. Whether I'm reading a book, enjoying a poem, or pondering philosophical ideas, these 
                pursuits enrich my life and ignite my imagination.
              </p>
              <h2>Sports</h2>
              <p class="about-text">
                Sports have always held a special place in my heart, combining physicality, strategy, and determination. 
                I love sports like tennis and basketball, finding joy in their competitive nature. I've dedicated 
                countless hours to training in the gym, improving my strength and fitness. I also explored calisthenics, 
                witnessing the incredible transformation it had on my body and mind. Now, I've found a balance by 
                combining elements from different disciplines, embracing the diversity of sports and constantly 
                challenging myself to improve. That is why I have recently been taking up bouldering, which I have 
                really enjoyed because it combines balance, strength and agility.
